Experimental x86-64 seL4-like microkernel for soft real-time use.

Core features:
    * Zero Dynamic Allocation: kernel memory is statically partitioned at boot
        to ensure determinism.
    * Real-Time Scheduling: implements a partitioned per-core EDF scheduler.
        It uses a static binary min-priority queue (O(log n) inserts/deletes,
        O(1) peek) supporting up to 64 TCBs per core.

Currently features a framebuffer console, soon to be deprecated in favor of a
UART serial driver for minimal overhead.

Kernel objetcs are partially mathematically verified using (Microsoft) Verus.

Note: this microkernel is a research project and is not intended for production
use. Project retains most of the structures from seL4, adapted to the Rust
language, but simplifies other mechanisms.
